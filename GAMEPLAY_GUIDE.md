## üí∞ Staking & Rewards

### Multiplier System

Your reward multiplier decreases with each wrong guess:

| Attempts | Multiplier | Example (10 STX deposit) |
|----------|------------|--------------------------|
| 1        | 5x         | Win 50 STX (+40 profit) |
| 2        | 4x         | Win 40 STX (+30 profit) |
| 3        | 3x         | Win 30 STX (+20 profit) |
| 4        | 2x         | Win 20 STX (+10 profit) |
| 5        | 1x         | Win 10 STX (break even) |
| 6        | 1x         | Win 10 STX (break even) |
| Lose     | 0x         | Lose 10 STX deposit     |

### Reward Calculation

```
Reward = Deposit Amount √ó Multiplier
Profit = Reward - Deposit Amount
```

**Examples:**

**Scenario 1: Lucky First Try**
- Deposit: 10 STX
- Win on attempt 1
- Multiplier: 5x
- Reward: 10 √ó 5 = 50 STX
- Profit: 50 - 10 = **40 STX profit** üéâ

**Scenario 2: Steady Win**
- Deposit: 20 STX
- Win on attempt 3
- Multiplier: 3x
- Reward: 20 √ó 3 = 60 STX
- Profit: 60 - 20 = **40 STX profit** üéâ

**Scenario 3: Close Call**
- Deposit: 5 STX
- Win on attempt 6
- Multiplier: 1x
- Reward: 5 √ó 1 = 5 STX
- Profit: 5 - 5 = **Break even** üòÖ

**Scenario 4: Loss**
- Deposit: 10 STX
- Lose after 6 attempts
- Multiplier: 0x
- Reward: 0 STX
- Loss: **-10 STX** üò¢

### Risk Management

**Conservative Strategy** (Low Risk)
- Stake: 1-5 STX per game
- Goal: Consistent small wins

## üí° Tips & Strategies

### Starting Words
Use words with common letters to maximize information:

**Best Starting Words:**
- **STARE** - Common vowels (A, E) and consonants (S, T, R)
- **CRANE** - Good mix of common letters
- **SLATE** - Popular Wordle starting word
- **AUDIO** - Covers 4 vowels

**Crypto-Themed Starters:**
- **CHAIN** - Likely to be in the word list
- **BLOCK** - Common blockchain term
- **STACK** - Fits the Stacks theme

### Letter Frequency
Most common letters in the word list:
1. **E** - Appears in 40% of words
2. **A** - Appears in 35% of words
3. **R** - Appears in 30% of words
4. **O** - Appears in 28% of words
5. **L** - Appears in 25% of words

### Strategy by Attempt

**Attempt 1-2: Information Gathering**
- Use words with different common letters
- Don't repeat letters unless you know they're in the word
- Focus on vowels (A, E, I, O, U)

**Attempt 3-4: Pattern Recognition**
- Use green letters in their correct positions
- Try yellow letters in different positions
- Eliminate gray letters completely

**Attempt 5-6: Calculated Guessing**
- Use all known information
- Consider word patterns (common endings: -ER, -ED, -LY)
- Think of crypto/blockchain terms

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **Repeating gray letters** - If a letter is gray, don't use it again
‚ùå **Ignoring yellow letters** - Yellow letters ARE in the word, just wrong position
‚ùå **Not using green letters** - Always use green letters in their correct positions
‚ùå **Random guessing** - Use logic and eliminate possibilities
‚ùå **Betting too much early** - Start small while learning

### Advanced Techniques

**1. Elimination Strategy**
- First guess: Eliminate 5 letters
- Second guess: Eliminate 5 more letters
- Third guess: Use remaining common letters
- Fourth guess: Should have enough info to solve

**2. Pattern Matching**
- Look for common word patterns
- Example: _LOCK could be BLOCK, CLOCK, FLOCK
- Use context clues from previous guesses

**3. Probability Thinking**
- If you have 3 green letters, calculate possible words
- Choose the most likely word based on letter frequency
- Consider the crypto/blockchain theme

## üîó Blockchain Integration

### How It Works

**1. Deposit Phase**
```
Player ‚Üí deposit-and-play(amount) ‚Üí Smart Contract
Smart Contract ‚Üí Creates game record ‚Üí Returns game-id
```

**2. Play Phase**
```
Player plays game in browser (no blockchain calls)
Game logic runs entirely on frontend
```

**3. Resolution Phase**
```
Game ends ‚Üí Frontend calls resolve-game(game-id, multiplier)
Smart Contract ‚Üí Records outcome ‚Üí Marks game as resolved
```

**4. Claim Phase**
```
Player ‚Üí claim-reward(game-id) ‚Üí Smart Contract
Smart Contract ‚Üí Transfers (deposit √ó multiplier) ‚Üí Player wallet
```

### Transaction Costs

**Testnet** (Free)
- Deposit: ~0.001 STX (gas fee)
- Resolve: ~0.001 STX (gas fee)
- Claim: ~0.001 STX (gas fee)

**Mainnet** (When deployed)
- Deposit: ~0.01-0.05 STX (gas fee)
- Resolve: ~0.01-0.05 STX (gas fee)
- Claim: ~0.01-0.05 STX (gas fee)

### Security Features

‚úÖ **Non-custodial** - You always control your STX
‚úÖ **Transparent** - All transactions on-chain
‚úÖ **Immutable** - Game outcomes cannot be changed
‚úÖ **Verifiable** - Anyone can verify game results
‚úÖ **Fair** - No house edge, pure skill-based

## ‚ùì FAQ

### General Questions

### Gameplay Questions
