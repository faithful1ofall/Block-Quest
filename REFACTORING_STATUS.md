## 🎯 Game Mechanics Summary

### Core Gameplay
- **5-Letter Word Guessing** (Wordle-style)
- **6 Maximum Attempts**
- **Color Feedback**:
  - 🟩 Green = Correct letter, correct position
  - 🟨 Yellow = Correct letter, wrong position
  - ⬜ Gray = Letter not in word

### Staking System
- Player deposits STX to play
- Multiplier starts at 5x
- Decreases by 1 with each wrong guess
- Win = Deposit × Multiplier
- Lose = Lose deposit

### Blockchain Flow
```
1. deposit-and-play(amount) → Returns game-id
2. Play game (frontend only)
3. resolve-game(game-id, multiplier) → Owner resolves
4. claim-reward(game-id) → Player claims winnings
```

## 📝 Next Steps

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. **Debug Contract Deployment**
   - Fix abort_by_response error
   - Successfully deploy word-game.clar
   - Verify contract functions

2. **Build Core Components**
   - WordGameBoard with 6×5 grid
   - Color-coded tile system
   - Input validation

3. **Implement Game Logic**
   - Word selection
   - Guess validation
   - Color calculation
   - Multiplier tracking

### Short Term
4. **Contract Integration**
   - Connect deposit function
   - Connect resolve function
   - Connect claim function

5. **UI Polish**
   - Retro pixel theme
   - Animations
   - Responsive design

### Long Term
6. **Testing & Launch**
   - Full gameplay testing
   - Contract testing
   - Documentation
   - Deployment

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Smart Contract (Clarity)
```clarity
;; Main Functions
- deposit-and-play: Player deposits STX, returns game-id
- resolve-game: Owner sets multiplier (0-5) based on win/lose
- claim-reward: Player claims winnings
- get-game-info: Read game data
```

### Frontend Stack
- React 19
- TailwindCSS
- Framer Motion
- Stacks.js
- Matter.js (to be removed)

### Word List (Sample)
```javascript
["CHAIN", "BLOCK", "MINTS", "NODES", "COINS",
 "LAYER", "ETHER", "BYTES", "PROOF", "VOTER",
 "STATE", "TRUST", "VALID", "SIGNS", "BUYER",
 "VAULT", "VALUE", "LOGIC", "ASSET", "OWNER",
 "TOKEN", "SMART", "PRICE", "TREND", "FUNDS"]
```

  - Status: ✅ Deployed and working
  - Can be adapted for word game rewards

### New Contract (In Progress)

## 💡 Alternative Approach

If contract deployment continues to fail, we can:

1. **Use Existing quest-nft Contract**
   - Adapt mint-quest-badge for game rewards
   - Use level parameter as multiplier
   - Simpler integration

2. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Game logic in frontend
   - Rewards via existing NFT contract
   - Faster to market

3. **Full Refactor** (Current Plan)
   - New dedicated word-game contract
   - Complete separation from NFT system
   - More flexible for future features
