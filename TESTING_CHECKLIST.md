## ‚è≥ Pending Tests (Requires Deployed Contract)

### Blockchain Integration
- [ ] Deposit transaction succeeds
- [ ] Game ID returned from contract
- [ ] Resolve transaction succeeds
- [ ] Claim transaction succeeds
- [ ] Correct reward amount received
- [ ] Transaction errors handled gracefully
- [ ] Gas fees calculated correctly

### Contract Functions
- [ ] deposit-and-play creates new game

- [ ] get-next-game-id increments properly

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Multiple games in sequence
- [ ] Claiming without resolving (should fail)

- [ ] Claiming twice (should fail)
- [ ] Invalid multiplier values (should fail)
- [ ] Non-owner trying to resolve (should fail)
