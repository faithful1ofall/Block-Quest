## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Physics Engine
```javascript
- Engine: Matter.js
- Gravity: 1 (realistic)
- Collision Detection: Built-in Matter.js
- Body Types: Static (ground/walls), Dynamic (blocks/projectiles)
- Rendering: Matter.Render with custom styling
```

### Game Loop
```
1. Player drags slingshot
2. Calculate trajectory and power
3. Launch projectile on release
4. Physics simulation runs
5. Collision detection triggers
6. Blocks destroyed, points awarded
7. Check win/lose conditions
8. Show appropriate modal
```

### Scoring System
```javascript
Wooden Block: 10 points
Stone Block: 25 points
Metal Block: 50 points
Crystal Block: 100 points
```

### Level Progression
```javascript
Level 1-5: Tutorial (3-4 rows of blocks)
Level 6-10: Easy (4-5 rows)
Level 11-20: Medium (5-6 rows, more metal)
Level 21+: Hard (6 rows, mostly metal)
```
